# Denoising MRI images using Random Matrix based PCA
This is an implementation of Marchenko-Pastur based noise removal technique on MRI images. See [Denoising of diffusion MRI using random matrix theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916303949) and the description on the .ipynb file for details. Here we used the dipy package.
